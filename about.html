            Welcome to the About Me page of Samuel Rios-Lazo!

Background:
I'm Samuel Rios-Lazo, a passionate individual born in the vibrant land of El Salvador. Growing up as the 5th of 6 children, I learned the value of teamwork, communication, and perseverance from a young age. My formative years were spent at Liceo San Miguel, where I laid the groundwork for my academic journey.

Education and Career Path:
After completing my high school education, I embarked on a transformative journey of service, dedicating two years of my life to a mission in the bustling city of SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil, under the auspices of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. This experience not only enriched my cultural understanding but also honed my leadership and interpersonal skills.

Upon returning, I pursued my passion for technology by studying Computer Science at Brigham Young University - Idaho (BYU-Idaho). There, I thrived academically, earning a Bachelor's Degree with a stellar GPA of 4.0 and receiving a Full Tuition Academic Scholarship. During my time at BYU-Idaho, I served as a Computer Science Teacher Assistant, where I had the privilege of imparting knowledge, guiding students in understanding complex programming concepts, and fostering a collaborative learning environment.

Professional Experience:
My professional journey also includes roles such as a CIT Online Drop-In Tutor and Community Manager at Chibox SV. In these positions, I leveraged my technical expertise and creativity to provide comprehensive assistance, drive marketing campaigns, and enhance brand visibility. Through strategic initiatives and a keen eye for design, I contributed to significant sales growth and customer engagement.

Passions and Hobbies:
Beyond the realm of technology, I find joy in various activities. Whether it's showcasing my skills on the soccer field, whipping up delicious meals with friends in the kitchen, or immersing myself in the tranquility of nature through walks and hikes, I believe in living life to the fullest and embracing every moment.

Skills and Languages:
As a web and software developer, I possess proficiency in a diverse range of programming languages and methodologies, including Python, C#, SQL, HTML/CSS, and JavaScript. My experience in Agile software development, coupled with strong problem-solving abilities and attention to detail, enables me to deliver high-quality solutions that meet the needs of clients and users alike. Additionally, my fluency in Spanish and Portuguese allows me to effectively communicate and collaborate in multicultural environments.
